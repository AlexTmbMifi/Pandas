# Pandas

Basic Pandas principles and methods. 
Examples which illustrate analysis data sets.

Data locates on folder **datasets**.

This project provides itself aggregation functions, text function, input/output files' functions.
Moreover, it demonstrates how to extrate data from DataFrames and Series.

I hope these notebooks attempt me to memorize useful functions :)/
